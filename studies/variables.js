/**
 * VARIABLES:
 * 
 * 0. Variables are the holding boxes for the data we are adding to our program. A variable can be hold data of different types:
 * some simple, like strings, numbers, and booleans, and others complex like arrays, objects, and functions. Variables are alterable
 * and can be changed into different values.
 * 
 * 1. There is a two step process for variables. First you must declare them with the name you will be giving the variable, Second 
 * you must give it a value. You can do both steps on the same line of code, which is called initializing: giving a variable an
 * initial value.
 *  
 * 
 * 2. var, let, and const
 * 
 * 3. Hoisting:

//Declaration
//the variable age is declared but since it has not been assigned a value it will return undefined

age = 28;
console.log(age); //28
